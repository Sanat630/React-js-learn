##      3. Air-Bnb (3rd learning project)

    A mostly reasonable approach to React and JSX.
This style guide is mostly based on the standards that are currently prevalent in JavaScript, although some conventions (i.e async/await or static class fields) may still be included or prohibited on a case-by-case basis. Currently, anything prior to stage 3 is not included nor recommended in this guide.
